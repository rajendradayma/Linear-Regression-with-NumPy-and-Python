# Linear-Regression-with-NumPy-and-Python
 Linear Regression with NumPy and Python. In this project, you will do all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery of the various algorithms yourself, 
Implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch
Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python
Create data visualizations and plots using matplotlib
